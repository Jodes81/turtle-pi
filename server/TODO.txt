Server
======
 - On all WebSockets disconnected: shut down turtle: stop cmd execution, motors, etc. Complication: some commands
        will be intended to maintain state on exit: e.g. LEDs
 - On second connection: disconnect first & revert to off state
 - REFACTOR...
    - DRY Commands



Client
======
 - CmdEditor: play & stop buttons
 - Joystick arrows & motor control
 - REFACTOR...
    - UNWEBIFY CmdButton/CmdButtman/CmdEditor/Blockly/ServerConn


Both
====
 - REFACTOR EVERYTHING. What a fucking mess; Asynchronous hell, no tests, blurred responsibilities... not 
        DRY. Cross client/server wetness. Also see Client/Server REFACTOR
 - Timeout: switch off everything
 - Archive area+buttons
